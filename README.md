Simple interactive site utilizing HTML5 and CSS3 showing my chosen color palette.
Design Reflection
Identity & Culture
The color palette I chose for my design system webpage draws directly from the landscape I see every day living in Colorado. The muted green mirrors the alpine meadows that blanket the foothills, while the deep navy captures late-evening skies over the Rockies just before full dark sets in. The bright cyan reflects the crisp, clear blue of a bluebird powder day. Even the cool gray and soft off-white draw from the granite faces and snowfields that define the high peaks. As someone who spends as much time as possible skiing, hiking, climbing, it felt natural to let that environment guide my visual choices. These colors feel authentic to me because they come from a place I have a real relationship with.
Accessibility Considerations
I have red-green colorblindness, which played a significant role in shaping the decisions behind this palette. You'll notice the palette doesn't lean on red or green as primary communicative colors, and that wasn't even a deliberate strategy at first, it was instinctual. But once I started thinking more critically about accessibility and WCAG guidelines, I realized that instinct actually aligned well with designing for broader readability. I focused heavily on contrast ratios and making sure text was legible against every background combination, because if a color pairing doesn't work for my eyes, there's a good chance it fails for other users too.
Design Process
The biggest challenge wasn't the HTML, I feel fairly confident structuring semantic markup at this point. The real grind was working through the CSS to making sure spacing, typography, and color all felt unified rather than like a random bunch of elements.
Future Applications
Moving forward, the biggest takeaway I'm carrying into my portfolio project and beyond is the idea of designing for everyone, not just for my own visibility needs or personal aesthetic preferences. My colorblindness gave me a head start in thinking about inclusive palettes, but true accessibility goes further than that. The most flexible parts of my system are the neutral tones and typographic hierarchy, which can adapt to almost any context. The least flexible element is probably the cyan accent, it's distinctive but might need adjustment depending on the project's tone. I plan to keep refining this system by testing it across different devices and contexts, and keep pushing toward designs that work for as many people as possible.
